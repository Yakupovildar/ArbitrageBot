- **Signal batch control**: Users can choose 1-5 signals per batch with 3-second intervals
- **Individual settings**: Each user has personal thresholds and signal limits
- **Real-time updates**: Settings changes apply immediately and persist in database

‚úÖ **AUTO-RECONNECTION SYSTEM (COMPLETE)**
- **30-minute cycles**: Automatic reconnection attempts every 30 minutes during trading hours
- **Source monitoring**: Tracks status of all 10 data sources in database
- **Smart recovery**: Prevents excessive reconnection attempts (15-min cooldown per source)

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Bot Framework**: Built on python-telegram-bot library providing async Telegram bot functionality with command handlers for user interaction.

**Market Data Integration**: Uses MOEX ISS API for real-time price feeds with built-in rate limiting and error handling to ensure reliable data access.

**Arbitrage Engine**: Central calculation engine that identifies spread opportunities between stock/futures pairs and generates trading signals based on configurable thresholds.

**Monitoring System**: Continuous background monitoring with configurable intervals that tracks multiple instrument pairs simultaneously and sends alerts to subscribed users.

**Position Management**: Tracks open arbitrage positions and monitors for closing opportunities based on spread convergence.

### Key Design Patterns

**Async/Await Architecture**: All I/O operations use asyncio for non-blocking execution, allowing concurrent monitoring of multiple instruments and user interactions.

**Configuration-Driven**: Centralized configuration system managing API endpoints, monitoring intervals, spread thresholds, and instrument mappings with environment variable support.

**Signal Processing**: Three-tier urgency system (normal, green, bright green) based on spread magnitude to prioritize high-value opportunities.

**Subscriber Model**: User subscription system allowing selective notification delivery with admin controls for bot management.

### Data Flow

Market data flows from MOEX API through the arbitrage calculator which generates signals based on spread analysis. Signals are then distributed to subscribed users via Telegram with formatted messages including position details and urgency indicators.

## External Dependencies

**MOEX ISS API**: Primary data source for stock and futures prices with RESTful JSON interface requiring rate limiting compliance.

**Telegram Bot API**: Message delivery and user interaction platform accessed through python-telegram-bot wrapper library.

**aiohttp**: HTTP client for async API communications with configurable timeouts and session management.

**Environment Variables**: 
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Bot authentication token
- `ADMIN_USER_IDS`: Comma-separated list of admin user IDs for bot management

**Python Libraries**: Standard asyncio, logging, datetime, and dataclasses for core functionality without external database requirements.
